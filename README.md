# Food Me
#### version 1.0.0

Food Me was built as part of a project for UC Berkeley Coding Boot Camp. The purpose of the program is to allow users a way to fulfill their cravings for specific food. It is broken down into three primary categories. **Make It**, **Find It** and **Deliver It.**

## Food Me Categories

Food Me is comprised of three primary subsections. Here's a closer look at each:

### Make It

After submitting the dish of choice into the input tab, the user can select to look for recipes for the item they choose. Once they hit it, up to 10 recipes will be returned. Once clicking on a dish they want to explore further, a modal of the recipe appears. At the bottom of the model, there's a button where the user can chose to save the food item.

### Find It

The user that chooses to go to a restaurant that serves the dish would use the **Find It** button on the app. Once they click the button, a list of restaurants appear utilizing the Google Places API. The information returned to the user include Rating, Price Range, Address, and Phone Number. There's also a link that will open the place directly in Google Places where other information and options provided by Google Places is provided.

### Deliver It

The user that wishes to have the food delivered to them can click on the **Deliver It** link which will give them a list of restaurants that deliver and links to GrubHub where people can get the food they want sent directly to them.
